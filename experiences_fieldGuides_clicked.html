                               <p>Nelson was born in Mozambique but fled his country of birth due to civil war. He was raised in South Africa as a Seswati boy and practiced tracking which later became his career. He studied Tourism in Fanshawe Canada and when he returned, he pursued his love for the bush by studying field guiding in Kwa-Zulu Natal. He is fascinated by the diversity of African cultures, languages (of which he speaks nine), and wildlife.</p>
